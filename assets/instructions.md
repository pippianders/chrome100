## Why use recovery images?

Recovery images can downgrade chromebooks to earlier versions and even upgrade if updates are blocked on the chromebook.

### Upgrading:

- Bypassing restrictions that prevent updating ChromeOS
- Using the latest ChromeOS features

### Downgrading:

- Using removed features such as guest mode before enrollment
- Using patched exploits

## Usage

ChromeOS recovery images come in a `.zip` file.

You will need:

- USB drive with at least 8 GB of storage
- [Chromebook Recovery Utility](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chromebook-recovery-utili/pocpnlppkickgojjlmhdmidojbmbodfm)

### Finding the right recovery image

Recovery images have a code name associated with them also referred to as the board name.

To find your board name visit the website `chrome://version` and find the line labelled **Firmware Version**. It will look something like `Google_Reks.7000.100.100`. Your Chromebook's firmware version is the word after `Google_` and before a period.
